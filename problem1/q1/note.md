### Study functions note:
- **`brighten`**:
  - Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/brighten.html
  - **`brighten(beta)`** shifts the intensity of all colors in the current colormap in the same direction. The colors brighten when beta is between 0 and 1, and they darken when beta is between -1 and 0. The magnitude of the change is proportional to the magnitude of beta.
- **`contrast`**: 
  - Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/contrast.html 
  - **`newmap = contrast(I)`** creates a grayscale colormap that enhances the contrast of image **`I`**. The new colormap increases the contrast among pixels that are difficult to distinguish visually, but have slightly different brightness values.
- **`histeq`**: 
  - Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/histeq.html
  - **`J = histeq(I)`** transforms the grayscale image **`I`** so that the histogram of the output grayscale image **`J`** has 64 bins and is approximately flat.
- **`imcontrast`**:
  - Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imcontrast.html
  - Use the **`imcontrast`** function to create an Adjust Contrast tool. The Adjust Contrast tool is an interactive contrast and brightness adjustment tool that you can use to adjust the black-to-white mapping used to display a grayscale image.
- **`imadjust`** :
  - Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imadjust.html
  - **`J = imadjust(I)`** maps the intensity values in grayscale image **`I`** to new values in **`J`**. By default, imadjust saturates the bottom 1% and the top 1% of all pixel values. This operation increases the contrast of the output image **`J`**.
